To run the program, you first need to compile it using a C++ compiler like g++. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the program files are saved. Then, compile the code by entering the appropriate command to build the program. If there are no errors, an executable file will be created. After that, run the program by executing the generated file. Once the program starts, it will perform the linked list and stack operations, displaying the results on the screen.
